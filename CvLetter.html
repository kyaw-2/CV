                <p class="dear"><strong>Dear Hiring Manager,</strong></p>
            <p class="firstpagh">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I am writing to express my interest in a position of site engineer within your Construction Company. While I am currently an intern at John Holland Group Construction Company(Australia) through online, and I recently graduated from Alison with a Diploma in Building Construction Methodology, and I am confident that my skills and knowledge will make me a valuable addition to your team.</p>
            <p class="secprag">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I believe that experience is not the only measure of success, and sometimes individuals without much experience can perform better than those with years of experience. Therefore, I would like to emphasize the value of my education at Alison. Alison is an online institute based in Galway, Ireland, and their Diplomas and Certificates are accredited by CPD (UK), which means that they are recognized by governments around the world. According to a learner survey, 75% of Alison's graduates are employed in their field of study, from the United States to India.</p>
            <p class="fourthprag">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Diploma in Construction is one of Alison's most popular civil engineering programs, designed by Akshay Kamath (BE Civil, ME Structural Engineering) to provide a fundamental understanding of construction in RCC buildings. The program covers topics such as gridlines marking, excavation, laying of PCC, shuttering works, concreting of footing, column, beam, and slab, monolithic casting in staircase, brickworks, concrete bands in brick walls, checking MEP works, sill concrete under the window, lintel beams above the openings, how Chajja or sunshade is provided as a cantilever from the lintel beam above the openings, placing mesh between column and brick wall, plastering case, and interior design.</p>
            <p class="first01">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Through this program, I have learned about substructure, superstructure, and finishing activities from a technical point of view and safety standards. I am eager to apply all of my knowledge and skills to the role of a site engineer within your team. However, I would require access to Architectural and Structural drawings to perform my duties effectively, and I am also capable of calculating the estimate of site costs. Please note that if I do not possess the necessary skills as declared, I am willing to be removed from the team without any salary.</p>
            <p class="first02">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition, I am currently studying for an Advanced Diploma in Steel Structure, designed by Dr. Damodar Maity, a Professor at the Department of Civil Engineering, India Institute of Technology Kharagpur. Despite my studies, I am more than capable of working while studying.</p>
            <p class="first03">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I am eager to set up an interview to discuss how my passion for the role of a site engineer and my knowledge could help your company achieve success. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
